# Below is the standard "check-release" Github Actions from the nice
# folks at r-libs. It works fine. The problem is that I really want
# to use renv with this package. But, if you do, you need to use
# setup-renv instead of setup-r-dependencies, obviously. The problem
# with that is that setup-renv seems unable to work with rstanarm, and
# maybe other packages. Either it does not build at all or, if it does,
# the cache stops working. Despite many hours of work, and Q/A with
# Posit Community, I could not get it to function. So, no renv for
# this package.
