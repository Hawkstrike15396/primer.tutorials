# Key point when considing r2u: 

# r2u is an apt repo, which via bspm becomes used 
# "automagically" via standard R calls of install.packages() and alike. 
# That last part is important: package installations that do not use install.packages() 
# (such as the RStudio GUI, renv, rig, ...) do not benefit from install.packages() 
# calling apt for you, and cannot take advantage of r2u.

# So, we can use renv or r2u but not both.
