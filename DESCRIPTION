Description: Collection of tutorials for use with Preceptor's Primer for 
    Bayesian Data Science. Makes extensive use of the tools in tutorial.helpers 
    package. This collection is currently in flux as we move much of the 
    content to the new r4ds.tutorials package. Several of the remaining 
    tutorials, especially for after Chapter 6, are not reliable.
