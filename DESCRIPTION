Description: Collection of tutorials for use with Preceptor's Primer for
    Bayesian Data Science. Makes extensive use of the tools in tutorial.helpers
    package. This collection is currently in flux as we move much of the
    content to the new r4ds.tutorials package. Several of the remaining
    tutorials, especially for after Chapter 6, are not reliable.
