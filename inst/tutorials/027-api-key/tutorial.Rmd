## Introduction

An application programming interface (API) key is a code used to identify and authenticate an application or user. They also act as a unique identifier and provide a secret token for authentication purposes. The **tidycensus** package works even without an Census API key, but you should still get one, not least because some packages, like **ibdr** require one.

## Getting a Census API Key

### Exercise 1

We can access the US Census API via the **tidycensus** package. The **tidycensus** package utilizes an API key to access Census data.

### 

Load the **tidycensus** package into your R session.

### 

Run `search()` in the Console to see the libraries that you've currently loaded. CP/CR.

```{r accessing-the-census-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

The output should include the string "package:tidycensus". Kyle Walker is also the author of the **[tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/)** package.

### Exercise 2

Now that we have the package needed to access the Census database, we need to get an API key. 

###

An API key is basically a password for an API, but they often come with certain restrictions. For example, the Census API only allows you to collect 50 variables (or columns) from a database at a time. 

### 

Visit [https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) and request an API key. Use your school or other organization name for the `Organization Name` field. Follow the steps and verify your API key via email. 

### 

Copy and paste your API key into the box below. If you don't want to share your API key, change a few letters to make it different after you have pasted it into the box.

```{r accessing-the-census-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

While an API key isn't mandatory for accessing the Census, it allows you to do more requests and use multiple computers to collect data. It's  also necessary for using the **tidycensus** package.

### Exercise 3

You may remember putting your GitHub Personal Access Token into your `.Renviron` file for safekeeping. We'll be doing the same for our Census API key, but the process looks a little bit different.

### 

The **tidycensus** package makes the process much simpler. Run `census_api_key("YOUR API KEY HERE", install = TRUE)` in the Console, substituting your API key in the field.

###

This should save your key into your `.Renviron` file. Restart your R session.

### 

Run `Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY")` in the Console. Copy-paste the command and the output in the space below. 

```{r accessing-the-census-3}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

### 

This should contain your Census API key. If you want to see where the key is stored, run `usethis::edit_r_environ()` in the Console. It should open up your `.Renviron` file and show you all of the keys that you have stored there so far. Make sure to close this file after every usage, for it stores very sensitive information that you don't want to accidentally alter or delete. 


## International data

We can use the **ibdr** package to get information about other countries from the US Census Bureau.

### Exercise 1

We will be making this plot:

<!-- DK: Fix this warning message: -->
<!-- Warning message: -->
<!-- `label_number_si()` was deprecated in scales 1.2.0. -->
<!-- â„¹ Please use the `scale_cut` argument of `label_number()` instead. -->
<!-- This warning is displayed once every 8 hours. -->
<!-- Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was generated.  -->

<!-- MH: Fixed. -->

```{r eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
sweden_pop <- get_idb(country = "Sweden",
        variables = "pop",
        year = 1990:2100) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year,
                       y = pop)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number())+
  labs(title = "Population of Sweden",
       subtitle = "1990 to 2100",
       y = "Population",
       x = "Year")
# API key required for github, here is the code
```

```{r, out.width= "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sweden-pop.png")
```

###

Load the `idbr` package. On the next line, run `get_idb()` with `country` set to `"Sweden"`, `variables"` to `"pop"`, and `year` to `1990:2100`.

```{r international-data-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r international-data-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(...)
get_idb(country = "...",
        variables = "...",
        year = 1990:2100)
```

### 

Notice how we can not only use historical data, but also projected data for the future. 

### Exercise 2

Let's make a plot. Pipe this into `ggplot()` setting `x` to `year` and `y` to `pop`. Use `geom_line()`

```{r international-data-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r international-data-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ..., y = ...)) + 
  geom_line()
```

### 

### Exercise 3

Add the `theme_minimal()` layer and the `scale_y_continuous()` layer setting `labels` to `scales::label_number()`. 

```{r international-data-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r international-data-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(... = scales::label_number())
```

### Exercise 4

Add the appropriate labels using `labs()`.

```{r international-data-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r international-data-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}

```

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like:

```{r, out.width= "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sweden-pop.png")
```

### 

Nice! We just successfully made a plot using international Census data. 

###

Go to [Chapter 12](https://walker-data.com/census-r/working-with-census-data-outside-the-united-states.html#visualizing-idb-data) of Kyle Walkers book on Census Data for information on more advanced plotting!

### Exercise 5

Now we are going to learn how to map this data.

###

This is the map we are going to make:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
get_idb(country = "all",
        year = 2021,
        variables = "tfr",
        geometry = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill = tfr)) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_bw() +
  coord_sf(crs = "ESRI:54030") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(fill = "Total fertility rate\n(2021)") 

```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/idb_map.png")
```

### 

Run `get_idb()` below setting `country` to `"all"`, `year` to `2021`, `variables` to `"tfr"`, and `geometry` to `TRUE`.

```{r international-data-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r international-data-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
get_idb(country ="...",
        year = ...,
        variables = "...",
        geometry = ...)
```

### 

By importing the geometry argument, we enable ourselves to map it. 

### Exercise 6

Copy/paste your code from above. Pipe your code into `ggplot()` and, within `aes()`, set `fill` to `tfr`. Additionally, add the `geom_sf()` layer.

```{r international-data-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r international-data-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(...)) +
  geom_sf()
```

### 

Our map is going to be shaded based on the `tfr` variable. 

### Exercise 7

Add the `theme_bw()` layer. Additionally, add the `coord_sf()` layer setting `crs` to `"ESRI:54030"`.

```{r international-data-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r international-data-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  theme_bw() + 
  coord_sf(crs = "...")
```

### 

Recall that by setting the `crs` argument, we make countries accurate relative to other countries.

### Exercise 8

Finally, add the `scale_fill_viridis_c()` layer and the `labs()` layer setting `fill` to `"Total fertility rate\n(2021)"`.

```{r international-data-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r international-data-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  labs(fill = "Total fertility rate\n(2021)")
```

### 

Your graph should look like this: 

```{r}
include_graphics("images/idb_map.png")
```

### 

We just successfully created a map using international Census data!

### Exercise 9

When making world maps, using animation or interactive functions will enhance the map greatly.

### 

We assigned the raw data we imported (in exercise 5) to `fertility_data` for you, which will be used in future exercises. Take a look at code below and run it.

```{r international-data-9, exercise = TRUE}
fertility_data$tooltip <- paste0(fertility_data$name, ": ", round(fertility_data$tfr, 2))
```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r international-data-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}

```

### 

We created a new `tooltip` column in our `fertility_data` object which is what will display when our mouse hovers over a country in the interactive map. It will display the country name, colon, and tfr rounded to the hundreths place. 

### Exercise 10

Load the `ggiraph` package; we will use this to create an interactive map. 

```{r international-data-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r international-data-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(...)
```

### 

Most of the mapping process is the same as a static graph; the only thing we will have to change is `geom_sf()` with one more step. 

### Exercise 11

Start a pipe with `fertility_data` and pipe it into `ggplot()`, setting `fill` to `tfr`. Additionally, add the `theme_bw()` layer.

```{r international-data-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r international-data-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
fertilizer |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(fill = ...)) +
  theme_bw()
```

### 

As you can see our setup is pretty similar.

### Exercise 12

Add the `geom_sf_interactive()` layer. Inside `aes()`, set `tooltip` to `tooltip` and `data_id` to `code`. Outside the `aes()` function, set `size` to `0.1`. 

```{r international-data-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r international-data-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_sf_interactive(aes(tooltip = tooltip, data_id = ...), size = 0.1)
```

### 

The `geom_sf_interactive()` sets up the interactive element of the graph.

### Exercise 13

Add the `coord_sf()`, `scale_fill_viridis_c()`, and `labs()` layers with the same arguments as before in the static graph. 

```{r international-data-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r international-data-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  coord_sf(crs = "ESRI:54030") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(fill = "...")
```

### 

Notice that the output still isn't interactive. This is where we have to utilize the `ggiraph` package.

### Exercise 14

Copy/paste your code from above. Assign the whole pipe to a variable named `map`. Start a new line with the `girafe()` function, setting `ggobj` to `map`.

```{r international-data-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r international-data-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
map <- ...
girafe(ggobj = map)
```

### 

Your map looks the same as the static one, but if you hover over a country, notice that a number pulls up.

### 

We successfully created a interactive graph with international data. 

### 

If you want to learn about other country-specific census databases, such as Cansensus (the Canadian Census), go to [Chapter 12](https://walker-data.com/census-r/working-with-census-data-outside-the-united-states.html#country-specific-census-data-packages) of Kyle Walker's Book.

## Summary

Now that you have finished, you should know how to get API keys for the Census, how to plot using `idbr`, and how to make maps with `geom_sf()`.
