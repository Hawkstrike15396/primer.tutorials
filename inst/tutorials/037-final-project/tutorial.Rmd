## Introduction
### 

The Terminal pane is next to the Console pane in the lower left portion of RStudio. We use the Console pane to talk to R. We use the Terminal pane to talk directly with the computer. Sadly, the Console and the Terminal speak different languages.

This tutorial will introduce the structure and uses of Terminal and go over the essential commands to utilize Terminal well.

### Exercise 1

Hit return two times in the Terminal to see what happens. The terminal has a string of characters ending in a $ before your cursor, called the **prompt**. After a command has been executed, a prompt will be generated on a new line to let you know that Terminal is ready for a new command.  Copy and paste the three lines below

### 

```{r introduction-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

The prompt acts as a quick way to tell you where in the computer you are. Terminal is sensitive to which folder location you are in just like R console.

### Exercise 2

Let's figure out which folder we are in. To see your current location within your computer, type the command `pwd` (**p**resent **w**orking **d**irectory) in the Terminal. Hitting return runs the command. Copy and paste all commands and results associated with this exercise below, as you will do for all the following exercises.  

### 

```{r introduction-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Notice how the last directory (folder) in the **path** is included in the prompt.

Your pasted code should look something like:

```{r}
include_graphics("images/pwd.png")
```
