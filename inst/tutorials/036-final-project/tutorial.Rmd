<!-- How do we check things like the existence of an About page? How do we check that that About page has what we want? -->

<!-- There are two ways to confirm details of final project: url to Github pages or interaction with R project on student computer. Maybe best is to tell them to open up this tutorial from within the RStudio instance which is showing their final project project. Then you know where stuff is. -->

<!-- TM: Done About page should have a link to the Github repo. An email address for contacting you. Check with grep from the Terminal. And a link to Kane’s Free High School Data Science Bootcamp. -->

<!-- Make sure that the index.Rmd page is cool, grabs the readers attention. Must show nice plot at top. -->

<!-- TM: Done Explain about pages which tell stories. Not too much in the index.Rmd page. The home page should not include more than 30 seconds worth of material. Pretty much just the four paragraph summary and then one key plot, which should look cool.  -->

<!-- TM: Done Make sure "About this site -->
<!-- Additional details about this project" and other junk is gone. 

grep about.Rmd "About this site" 

Should return nothing.
-->

<!-- Also delete garbage from index.Rmd, like "Learn more about creating websites" And check. -->

<!-- Check out the Github repo for their project. Github repo should not be "final project". Must be descriptive! Good occasion to teach them how to change the name of a Github repo. Show them how to do it. First, pull/push everything so that it is all on Github. Then delete the R project folder. Then change name of repo. Then re-clone it using the new url.   -->


<!-- Minimize the stuff in the index.Rmd. You will knit this file a million times. So, remove all stuff from there that you can.  -->

<!-- Something which shows you added some code comments. -->

<!-- TM: Done Open image in New tab. -->

<!-- TM: Done Explain how to pin. -->

<!-- TM: Done Two examples for each sentence. Consistent across the sentences, so you will have two paragraphs at the end which you like. Ideally, use actual projects. Maybe your and Varun's projects! Maybe the knowledge drops after the submission in each are bad examples!? -->


## Introduction
### 

Your final project is the first entry in your professional portfolio. Few employers will ever ask to see your high school or college transcripts. They will want to see what you can **do**, what you can **make** with your own two hands. 


## Pimp Your Github Account
### 

Your Github account should look professional. Read [this essay](https://www.davidkane.info/post/2020-01-18-pimp-my-github/) for details about what that means. This section will guide you. 

### Exercise 1

Write a bio for your Github account. Once you have added it to your account, copy and paste the bio below.

### 

```{r pimp-your-github-acc-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 6)
```


### Exercise 2

Add a photo to your Github account. You do not have to use a photo of yourself — some people are shy — but you should use something other than the GitHub default.


###

Once the photo is uploaded, find it go to your profile page (`github.com/your-username`). Right click your updated profile picture and press "Open image in new tab".

```{r out.width="700px"}
include_graphics("images/open_profile.png")
```

Copy/paste the url of the page that is opened containing your photo here:

```{r pimp-your-github-acc-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 1)
```


### Exercise 3

Pin your final project repo to your profile page following the instructions listed [here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/pinning-items-to-your-profile).

###

Paste the URL of your pimped github account below. It should looks like `github.com/your-username`.

```{r pimp-your-github-acc-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 1)
```

## Create Your Project Summary
### 

Next we'll be making a four sentence summary of your final project. This will be how each of your presentations begins.

### Exercise 1

The first sentence includes the key nouns in the title, either as a simple statement or a rhetorical question.

###

Enter your first sentence in the box below. For example, "The prevalent emotions in mainstream music have been changing every decade." or "Covid-19 deaths vary tremendously by state."

```{r final-project-summary-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

###

A good first sentence will set the foundation for the rest of the introduction while keeping the listener engaged. A **bad** example of a first sentence is "I studied Covid deaths in my final project".

### Exercise 2

Next we'll be making our fourth sentence (Yes we're going out of order). This should include the key takeaway from your project that you want people to remember, almost always a statistical claim about how variable X varies with variable Y.

###

Enter your fourth sentence in the box below. For example, "Today's music is almost twice as angry as the music from the 1960's" or "The number of Covid-19 deaths in the 15 hardest hit states is greater than the rest combined".

```{r final-project-summary-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

###

An example of a **bad** fourth sentence is "This study's analysis will provide answers to which factors cause more Covid-19 deaths to occur". 

### Exercise 3

The second and third sentences are all about your data. Where did you get it? How did you clean it? How are variables X and Y measured and defined? 

###

Enter your second and third sentences into the box below. For example, "The following data was pulled from the spotifyr and billboard packages. Then, the relevant data frames were joined to analyze the relationship between the intensity and positivity of tracks from the 1960s to the 2010s" or "This was sourced from a data set which used data originally from the CDC. Mapping data was then used to visualize the Covid-19 deaths by state in an intuitive format".

```{r final-project-summary-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

###

A ***bad** example of the second and third sentences is "I have used an online data set to show Covid in the country using fill. I wanted to do this in order to show the relationships in the data."

### Exercise 4

It's time to put all all 4 sentences together! Start by pasting your answer to Exercise 1, Exercise 3, and then Exercise 2 (since we went out of order) in the answer box below. 

###

Here are both of the example paragraph's all together: 
  
  The prevalent emotions in mainstream music have been changing every decade. The following data was pulled from the spotifyr and billboard packages. Then, the relevant data frames were joined to analyze the relationship between the intensity and positivity of tracks from the 1960s to the 2010s. The analysis found that today's music is almost twice as angry as the music from the 1960's.

Covid-19 deaths vary tremendously by state. This was sourced from a data set which used data originally from the CDC. Mapping data was then used to visualize the Covid-19 deaths by state in an intuitive format. The visualization exemplifies the fact that the number of Covid-19 deaths in the 15 hardest hit states is greater than the rest combined 

```{r final-project-summary-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 5)
```

Read your paragraph aloud to make sure it sounds right and makes sense to the listener as a paragraph. If needed add transitions between sentences and extra information.

###

You're ready to practice presenting your final project in class!

## Meet Final Project Requirements
###

Now, we'll make sure that your final project has everything it needs to look professional.

### Exercise 1

Make sure that this tutorial is open in the same R Session as your final project for the rest of this section.

###

First, let's check whether you have the appropriate files in your project. Run `list.files()` in the console (same session as your final project). Paste the result in the box below.

```{r final-project-reqs-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 4)
```

This should return the files "index.Rmd", "about.Rmd", "sources.Rmd", and "_site.yml" at the bare minimum.

### Exercise 2

We'll now examine each file starting with `index.Rmd`. The goal is for the home page to not include more than 30 seconds worth of material.

  If you haven't already, start by including your four sentence summary from the previous section after the header of your `index.Rmd` file.

###

In the **terminal** run `head index.Rmd`. Paste the command and output below.

```{r final-project-reqs-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 4)
```

###

The result should include most (if not all) of your summary paragraph.

### Exercise 3

The home page should only include one key plot which draws the attention of the viewer.

###

To make sure you only have one home page plot, run `cat index.Rmd | grep ggplot` in the terminal. Paste the command and response into the box below.

```{r final-project-reqs-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

###

This should only return one line. If it returns multiple you still haven't followed the instructions above. You should make another page for any extra plots by creating another R Markdown file and adding it to the `_site.yml` file like in the Distill tutorial.

### Exercise 4

Now let's check the "About" page.
Delete the default text such as "About this site" and "Some additional details about the website".

###

To check this, run `cat about.Rmd | grep "About this site"` in the terminal tab. Paste the command and output into the box below.

```{r final-project-reqs-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

This should **not** return anything if you've correctly removed the default text.

### Exercise 5

In this file you should include at least "About Me" and "About this Project" sections, with descriptions of each underneath their respective headers.

###

To check this run `cat about.Rmd | grep "## About Me"` in the terminal. Copy paste the command and output below.

```{r final-project-reqs-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

###

This should return "## About Me" to signify that you've included that as a header in your "about.Rmd" file.

### Exercise 6

Make sure that you've added your email somewhere in your About Page so that visitors have the option to contact you regarding the project. 

###

Run `cat about.Rmd | grep "@"` in the terminal to make sure your email is visible. Paste the command and output in the box below. 

```{r final-project-reqs-6}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

###

This should return the line with your email. If nothing is returned, you haven't followed the instructions above.

### Exercise 7

If you haven't already add the link to your GitHub repo for this project as a hyperlink. Add a link to the bootcamp website as well using the code `[Kane's Free Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/)`.

###

Run the line `cat about.Rmd | grep "bootcamp.davidkane"` in the terminal to confirm that you've included the hyperlink. Paste the result below.

```{r final-project-reqs-7}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

If you've done this correctly it should return the line including the link to the bootcamp website.

<!-- TM: Add checks for "Sources.Rmd"? -->

###

Congratulations, you're project is ready for submission!

## Final Project Spreadsheet
###

To "submit" your project, we'll be adding it as a row in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WojOexL5DNau54fdbwGSwkZuFX2KuOskQEA38IUP7eM/edit?usp=sharing). This section will guide you through that process.

<!-- TM: Will need to update spreadsheet link for each bootcamp -->

### Exercise 1

Open the spreadsheet linked above. In the first column enter your email. This should be your personal email (not associated with your school or organization). Enter your name in column "B" as well.

###

Paste the email you entered in the spreadsheet below.

```{r final-project-spreadsheet-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

### Exercise 2

In column "C" you should paste the link to your Github account. This should be the same page that you personalized when you "Pimped your Github". The link should **NOT** be the URL to your project's Github page.

###

Paste this Github account link in the answer box below.

```{r final-project-spreadsheet-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

### Exercise 3

Next we'll enter your project name in column "D". This should be a relatively short title which describes your project's topic in [Title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case).

###

Enter your project title below.

```{r final-project-spreadsheet-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

### Exercise 4

In column "E", you'll enter the **Github Pages URL** to your project website. It should look like `your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`. This should **NOT** be the URL to your final project GitHub Repo.

###

Enter this project URL in the box below.

```{r final-project-spreadsheet-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

### Exercise 5

In the final column, you'll enter a one sentence takeaway of your project. This can be your fourth sentence from the project summary you created earlier. Make sure you use proper spelling and grammar conventions.

###

Enter your takeaway sentence below.

```{r final-project-spreadsheet-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

Make sure you have the same information in the tutorial and on the spreadsheet. You may also submit a picture or link of your project in the Final-Projects discord channel.

## Summary
### 

Your final project is the first entry in your professional portfolio. As long as you follow all the instructions in this tutorial, people (including professional data scientists) will be impressed.
