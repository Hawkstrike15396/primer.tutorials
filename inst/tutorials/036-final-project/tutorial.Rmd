## Introduction
### 

Your final project is the first entry in your professional portfolio. Few employers will ever ask to see your high school or college transcripts. They will want to see what you can **do**, what you can **make** with your own two hands. 

###

Here is a long list of key elements for every final project. Read through this list and then create a rough draft of your project. Only continue this tutorial *after* you have completed a rough draft.

* The project is stored in a public repo under your Github account with a sensible name like `baseball-pitching` not a stupid name like `my-project-final`. This repo is clean and well-organized. It has a simple README which describes the project and, at the top, provides a link to your Quarto website. All junk files have been deleted. If there are a lot of individual files --- like a dozen csv files for the raw data --- then you have organized them sensibly, in this case storing them all in a data/ directory.

* It is a Quarto website. The home page, which is created from `index.qmd`, should grab the readers attention. It includes one plot, the most interesting/important plot which you have. It also includes your paragraph summary of the project. It is clean and professional looking. It does not show code or stupid messages.

* There is an About page, created from `about.qmd`. This page includes a sentence or two about who you are, a link to your Github account and an email address which people can use to contact you. On a separate line, it includes a sentence like "This project was created as a part of Kane's Data Science Bootcamp." linking the name of the course to the webpage: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/. Feel free to word this sentence however you like.

* There is a Sources page, created from `sources.qmd`, which provides a paragraph or two of prose about the data sources for your project. Where did you get the data from? What did you do to clean the data? Which observations, if any, did you remove? This is, more or less, a written description of all the steps which were completed before you created you model.

* There is a Models page, created from `models.qmd`, which provides details about the model which you used. This does not show any code. Indeed, nowhere does the project show code. If someone wants to look at your code, they can go to your Github repo. First, this page will include the mathematical formula of your final model. (See examples in the Primer.) Second, this page will include information about the model's parameters, generated from the fitted model. This can take the form of a table --- see the **gtsummary** package for a useful approach: https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/. Or you can just print out the fitted model. Third, explain what the parameters of the model mean. Again, the Primer has many useful examples.

* Do not mention the Cardinal Virtues. No one else uses those as we do, as a map for tackling a data science project. Feel free to discuss topics like validity, stability and representativeness. Those concepts are used by everyone. But you don't have to discuss them.

* Optionally, you might have other pages, named however you like, that answer other questions and/or try other models. How would you answer change if you used a different model from the one you eventually settled on? Think of these as "stories" which you might tell someone interested in your topic, each page a separate "exhibit" which tells the reader something interesting about the data or the model or the answer.




### 

**Finish at least a rough draft of your project before starting this tutorial.** This tutorial does not show you how to make a final project. Instead, it just allows us to confirm that you have done so.

### 

There are two broad categories of final projects: those without a statistical model and those with one. If your final project does not include a statistical model, then skip those questions which refer to it.


## Pimp Your GitHub Account
### 

Your GitHub account should look professional. This section will guide you.

<!-- Read [this essay](https://www.davidkane.info/post/2020-01-18-pimp-my-github/) for details about what that means. -->

### Exercise 1

Write a bio for your GitHub account. Once you have added it to your account, copy and paste the bio below.

### 

```{r pimp-your-github-acc-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 2

Add a photo to your GitHub account. You do not have to use a photo of yourself — some people are shy — but you should use something other than the GitHub default.


### 

Once the photo is uploaded, find it go to your profile page (`github.com/your-username`). Right click your updated profile picture and press "Open image in new tab".

```{r out.width = "700px"}
include_graphics("images/open_profile.png")
```

Copy/paste the url of the page that is opened containing your photo here:

```{r pimp-your-github-acc-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 1)
```

### Exercise 3

Pin your final project repo to your profile page following the instructions listed [here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/pinning-items-to-your-profile).

### 

Paste the URL of your pimped GitHub account below. It should looks like `github.com/your-username`.

```{r pimp-your-github-acc-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 1)
```

## Create Your Project Summary
### 

Next we'll be making a four or five sentence summary of your final project. You will begin your Demo Day presentations with this summary.

### Exercise 1

The first sentence includes the key nouns in the title, either as a simple statement or a rhetorical question.

### 

Enter your first sentence in the box below. For example, "The prevalent emotions in mainstream music have been changing every decade." or "Covid-19 deaths vary tremendously by state."

```{r create-your-project--1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

### 

A good first sentence will set the foundation for the rest of the introduction while keeping the listener engaged. An example of a **bad** first sentence is "I studied Covid deaths in my final project".

### Exercise 2

Next we'll be making our last sentence. (Yes, we're going out of order). This should include the key takeaway from your project that you want people to remember, almost always a statistical claim about how variable X varies with variable Y. If you have a model, this statement will include specific numbers. If you don't have a model, the statement will just be directional.

### 

Enter your fourth sentence in the box below. For example, "Today's music is almost twice as angry as the music from the 1960's" or "The number of Covid-19 deaths in the 15 hardest hit states is greater than the rest combined". Those are good examples of statements for projects without a statistical model. 

With a statistical model, we will have specific numbers to include. Examples: "Each decade since the 1960s has been associated with a 5% increase in anger, plus or minus 1%." "An extra million people in a state's population is associated with a 2% to 8% increase in Covid deaths."

```{r create-your-project--2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

### 

An example of a **bad** fourth sentence: "This study's analysis will provide answers to which factors cause more Covid-19 deaths to occur."

###

Note that the sentences feature a specific number, as well as a range describing your uncertainty about that number. You need both. You do not need to use overly "statistical" language. After all, you are communicating mostly with non-statisticians.

### Exercise 3

The second and third sentences are all about your data. Where did you get it? How did you clean it? How are variables X and Y measured and defined? 

### 

Enter your second and third sentences into the box below. For example, "The following data was pulled from the spotifyr and billboard packages. Then, the relevant data frames were joined to analyze the relationship between the intensity and positivity of tracks from the 1960s to the 2010s." or "This was sourced from a data set which used data originally from the CDC. Mapping data was then used to visualize the Covid-19 deaths by state in an intuitive format".

```{r create-your-project--3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

A ***bad** example of the second and third sentences is "I have used an online data set to show Covid in the country using fill. I wanted to do this in order to show the relationships in the data."

### Exercise 4

Projects with a statistical model should devote the 4th sentence to describing the model. (Projects without a statistical model will generally not have a fourth sentence.)

Enter your fourth sentences into the box below, if you have one. For example, "I estimated a Bayesian regression model with song positivity as the dependent variable and year as an independent variable." "I created a Bayesian linear model with state Covid mortality rate as the dependent variable and state population total as the independent variable."

Obviously, if you model is more complex --- if, for example, it includes several right-hand side variables --- your sentence should be longer, within reason.

```{r create-your-project--4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

### Exercise 5

<!-- DK: These examples could be better. Perhaps replace them with examples from June 2023 class. -->

It's time to put all all 4 or 5 sentences together! Paste the compendium of your sentences from the exercises above into the answer box below. 

### 

Here are both of the example paragraphs in the case without a statistical model: 
  
The prevalent emotions in mainstream music have been changing every decade. The following data was pulled from the spotifyr and billboard packages. Then, the relevant data frames were joined to analyze the relationship between the intensity and positivity of tracks from the 1960s to the 2010s. The analysis found that today's music is almost twice as angry as the music from the 1960's.

Covid-19 deaths vary tremendously by state. This was sourced from a data set which used data originally from the CDC. Mapping data was then used to visualize the Covid-19 deaths by state in an intuitive format. The visualization exemplifies the fact that the number of Covid-19 deaths in the 15 hardest hit states is greater than the rest combined. I created a Bayesian linear model with state Covid mortality rate as the dependent variable and state population total as the independent variable.

###

With a statistical model, we would have:

The prevalent emotions in mainstream music have been changing every decade. The following data was pulled from the spotifyr and billboard packages. Then, the relevant data frames were joined to analyze the relationship between the intensity and positivity of tracks from the 1960s to the 2010s. I estimated a Bayesian regression model with song positivity as the dependent variable and year as an independent variable. Each decade since the 1960s has been associated with a 5% increase in anger, plus or minus 1%.

Covid-19 deaths vary tremendously by state. This was sourced from a data set which used data originally from the CDC. Mapping data was then used to visualize the Covid-19 deaths by state in an intuitive format. An extra million people in a state's population is associated with a 2% to 8% increase in Covid deaths.

```{r create-your-project--5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 5)
```

Read your paragraph aloud to make sure it sounds right and makes sense to the listener as a paragraph. If needed, add transitions between sentences and extra information.

### 

You're ready to practice presenting your final project in class!

## Meet Final Project Requirements
### 

Now, we'll make sure that your final project has everything it needs to look professional.

### Exercise 1

Make sure that this tutorial is open in the same RStuido instance as your final project for the rest of this section.

### 

First, let's check whether you have the appropriate files in your project. Run `list.files()` in the Console (same instance as your final project). Paste the result in the box below.

```{r meet-final-project-r-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 4)
```

This should return files like "index.qmd", "about.qmd", "sources.qmd", and "_quarto.yml" at the bare minimum.

### Exercise 2

We'll now examine each file, starting with `index.qmd`. The goal is for the home page to not include more than 30 seconds worth of material.

If you haven't already, start by including your four or five sentence summary from the previous section at the top of your `index.qmd` file.

### 

Run `head index.qmd` in the Terminal. CP/CR.

```{r meet-final-project-r-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 4)
```

### 

The result should include most (if not all) of your summary paragraph. 

After you insert a graphic, you are free to place the summary at the bottom. It is up to you! But your home page must provide an overview of what you did and a cool looking graphic to pique reader interest.

### Exercise 3

The home page should only include one key plot which draws the attention of the viewer.

### 

<!-- DK: Does not have to be a ggplot on this page. After all, they might pre-make the image and just load it up here. -->

To make sure you only have one home page plot, run `cat index.qmd | grep ggplot` in the Terminal. Paste the command and response into the box below.

```{r meet-final-project-r-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

This should only return one line. If it returns multiple you still haven't followed the instructions above. You should make another page for any extra plots by creating another Quarto Document and adding it to the `_quarto.yml` file as in the Quarto Websites tutorial.

### Exercise 4

Now let's check the "About" page.

Delete the default text such as "About this site" and "Some additional details about the website".

### 

To check this, run `cat about.qmd | grep "About this site"` in the Terminal tab. CP/CR

```{r meet-final-project-r-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

This should **not** return anything if you've correctly removed the default text.

### Exercise 5

In this file you should include at least "About Me" and "About this Project" sections, with descriptions of each underneath their respective headers.

### 

To check this run `cat about.qmd | grep "## About Me"` in the Terminal. CP/CR.

```{r meet-final-project-r-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

This should return "## About Me" to signify that you've included that as a header in your `about.qmd` file.

### Exercise 6

Make sure that you've added your email somewhere in your About Page so that visitors have the option to contact you regarding the project. 

### 

Run `cat about.qmd | grep "@"` in the Terminal to make sure your email is visible. Paste the command and output in the box below. 

```{r meet-final-project-r-6}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

This should return the line with your email. If nothing is returned, you haven't followed the instructions above.

### Exercise 7

<!-- DK: Split into two questions. -->

If you haven't already add the link to your GitHub repo for this project as a hyperlink. Add a link to the bootcamp website as well using the code `[Kane's Free Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/)`.

### 

Run the line `cat about.qmd | grep "bootcamp.davidkane"` in the Terminal to confirm that you've included the hyperlink. Paste the result below.

```{r meet-final-project-r-7}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

If you've done this correctly it should return the line including the link to the bootcamp website.

<!-- TM: Add checks for "Sources.qmd"? -->

### 

Congratulations, you're project is ready for submission!

## Final Project Spreadsheet
### 

To "submit" your project, we'll be adding it as a row in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kcbtBdRiSOq4ZuEIs032XNxB9O7GndCBSEMWzJlZuhc). This section will guide you through that process.


### Exercise 1

Open the spreadsheet linked above. In the first column enter your email. This should be your personal email (not associated with your school or organization). Enter your name in column "B" as well.

### 

Paste the email you entered in the spreadsheet below.

```{r final-project-spread-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

### Exercise 2

In column "C" you should paste the link to your Github account. This should be the same page that you personalized when you "Pimped your Github". The link should **NOT** be the URL to your project's Github page.

### 

Paste this Github account link in the answer box below.

```{r final-project-spread-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

### Exercise 3

Next we'll enter your project name in column "D". This should be a relatively short title which describes your project's topic in [Title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case).

### 

Enter your project title below.

```{r final-project-spread-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

### Exercise 4

In column "E", you'll enter the **Quarto Pub** link to your project website. It should look like `https://your-username.quarto.pub/your-project-slug`. This should **NOT** be the URL to your final project GitHub Repo.

### 

Enter this project URL in the box below.

```{r final-project-spread-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

### Exercise 5

In the final column, you'll enter a one sentence takeaway of your project. This can be the last sentence from the project summary you created earlier, although you might modify it since the reader would not have seen the other sentences in the paragraph. Make sure you use proper spelling and grammar conventions.

### 

Enter your takeaway sentence below.

```{r final-project-spread-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

Make sure you have the same information in the tutorial and on the spreadsheet. You may also submit a picture or link of your project in the Final-Projects discord channel.

## Summary
### 

Your final project is the first entry in your professional portfolio. As long as you follow all the instructions in this tutorial, people (including professional data scientists) will be impressed.
