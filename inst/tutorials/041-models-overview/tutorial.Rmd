## Introduction
### 

This tutorial covers [Chapter 4: Models](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/models.html) of [*Preceptorâ€™s Primer for Bayesian Data Science: Using the Cardinal Virtues for Inference*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) by [David Kane](https://davidkane.info/). 

## Wisdom
### 

*The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.* - Socrates

### Exercise 1

In your own words, describe the key components of Wisdom for working on a data science problem.

```{r wisdom-1}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Wisdom requires the creation of a Preceptor Table, an examination of our data, and a determination, using the concept of validity, as to whether or not we can (reasonably!) assume that the two come from the same population.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 2

Define a Preceptor Table.

```{r wisdom-2}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "A Preceptor Table is the smallest possible table of data with rows and columns such that, if there is no missing data, it is easy to calculate the quantities of interest.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 3

Describe the key components of Preceptor Tables in general, without worrying about this specific problem.

```{r wisdom-3}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The rows of the Preceptor Table are the units. The outcome is at least one of the columns. If the problem is causal, there will be at least two (potential) outcome columns. The other columns are covariates. If the problem is causal, at least one of the covariates will be a treatment.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 4

What are the units for this problem?

```{r wisdom-4}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The units are individual voters.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Note that this is not all American adults or even all registered voters. To answer our question, we only need information about actual voters. Any other rows would be superfluous.

### Exercise 5

What is/are the outcome/outcomes for this problem?

```{r wisdom-5}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The outcome is the candidate for whom the vote was cast.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Looking at the question, this formulation is too broad. We don't actually need to know the name of the candidate. We just need to know if the vote was cast for Biden or not. The name of the candidate, if it was not Biden, is irrelevant to our question.

### Exercise 6

What are the covariates for this problem?

```{r wisdom-6}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "There are no covariates.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

If the question referred to who will win the election, then we would at least have to add a column for state of residence in order to tabulate electoral votes.

### Exercise 7

What are the treatments, if any, for this problem?

```{r wisdom-7}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "There is no treatment.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

### 

This is a predictive model, not a causal model, so there are no treatments, by definition. Recall that treatment is just a covariate which, given the question we are trying to answer, might at least in theory be manipulable.

### Exercise 8

Write one sentence describing the data you have to answer your question.

```{r wisdom-8}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "We have data from a YouGov poll of 1,559 US adult citizens, conducted March 10 - 12, 2024, indicating which respondents intend to vote for Joe Biden and which do not.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 9

In your own words, define "validity" as we use the term.

```{r wisdom-9}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Validity is the consistency, or lack thereof, in the columns of the data set and the corresponding columns in the Preceptor Table.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 10

What can't we do if the assumption of validity is not true?

```{r wisdom-10}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "We can't combine the Preceptor Table and the data in order to construct the Population Table.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 11

Provide one reason why the assumption of validity might not hold for this problem.

```{r wisdom-11}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "There is not a one-to-one correspondence between our data (which is about an reported intention to vote for Biden) and our Preceptor Table (which records an actual vote).",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

What we tell other people we will do is often not what we actually do. Consider a voter who is embarrassed about her support for Biden. Perhaps she perceives the interviewer as a Republican and doesn't care to admit to him, in March, her support for Biden. But, in November, in the privacy of the polling booth, she votes for Biden. In her case, the outcome from the data (what she told the pollster) did not have a *valid* correspondence with her behavior in the polling booth.


### Exercise 12

Summarize the state of your work so far in one or two sentences. Make reference to the data you have and to the question you are trying to answer. 


```{r wisdom-12}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Using data from a YouGov poll of 1,559 US adult citizens, conducted March 10 - 12, 2024, we seek to understand what proportion of voters will support Biden in the 2024 election. In particular, we want to estimate the odds that, if we meet two voters, both will have voted for Biden?",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

## Justice
### 

*Justice is truth in action.* - Benjamin Disraeli


### Exercise 1

In your own words, name the four key components of Justice for working on a data science problem.

```{r justice-1}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Justice concerns four topics: the Population Table, stability, representativeness, and unconfoundedness.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 2

In your own words, define a Population Table.

```{r justice-2}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The Population Table includes a row for each unit/time combination in the underlying population from which both the Preceptor Table and the data are drawn.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 3

Describe the Population Table for this problem. In particular, are any of the rows in the Preceptor Table also rows in the data? Are there other rows in the Population Table which are not from the Preceptor Table or the data? If so, describe some of those rows.

```{r justice-3}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Each row in the Population Table corresponds to a person/date combination. None of the rows for the Preceptor Table and the data overlap. Rows from the overall population feature dates outside the survey dates and the election.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 4

In your own words, define the assumption of "stability" when employed in the context of data science.

```{r justice-4}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Stability means that the relationship between the columns in the Population Table is the same for three categories of rows: the data, the Preceptor Table, and the larger population from which both are drawn.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Stability is all about *time*. Is the relationship among the columns in the Population Table stable over time? In particular, is the relationship --- which is another way of saying "mathematical formula" --- at the time the data was gathered the same as the relationship at the (generally later) time references by the Preceptor Table.


### Exercise 5

Provide one reason why the assumption of stability might not be true in this case. (This is somewhat of a trick question.)

```{r justice-5}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Our Population Table is so simple that stability is true almost automatically true. There is only one column!",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Stability might become important as we think about the actual process by which we might meet the two voters in our original question, but, in terms of the Population Table itself, there is no problem.

### Exercise 6

In your own words, define the assumption of "representativeness" when employed in the context of data science.


```{r justice-6}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Representativeness, or the lack thereof, concerns two relationship, among the rows in the Population Table. The first is between the Preceptor Table and the other rows. The second is between our data and the other rows.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

<!-- XX: Keep one of these. -->

<!-- Ideally, we would like both the Preceptor Table *and* our data to be random samples from the population. Sadly, this is almost never the case. -->

<!-- Stability looks across time periods. Reprentativeness looks within time periods. -->

<!-- The more expansive your Preceptor Table, the more important the assumption of representativeness becomes. -->

### Exercise 7

Provide one reason why the assumption of representativeness might not be true in this case.

```{r justice-7}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "XX",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 8

In your own words, define the assumption of "unconfoundedness" when employed in the context of data science.

```{r justice-8}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Unconfoundedness means that the treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes, when we condition on pre-treatment covariates.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

<!-- XX: Keep one. -->

<!-- This assumption is only relevant for causal models. We describe a model as "confounded" if this is not true.  -->

<!-- The easiest way to ensure unconfoundedness is to assign treatment randomly. -->

### Exercise 9

Provide one reason why the assumption of unconfoundness might not be true (or relevant) in this case.

```{r justice-9}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Place correct answer here.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 10

Summarize the state of your work so far in two or three sentences. Make reference to the data you have and to the question you are trying to answer. Feel free to copy from your answer at the end of the Wisdom Section. Mention at least one specific problem which casts doubt on your approach. 


```{r justice-10}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "XX.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

## Courage
### 

*Courage is found in unlikely places.* - J.R.R. Tolkien


### Exercise 1

<!-- DK: Not sure I like this answer. -->

In your own words, name the key goal of Courage and the process we use to get there.

```{r courage-1}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Courage selects the data generating mechanism. We first specify the mathematical formula which connects the outcome variable we are interested in with the other data that we have. We explore different models. We need to decide which variables to include and to estimate the values of unknown parameters. We check our models for consistency with the data we have. We avoid hypothesis tests. We select one model.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 2

Load the **brms** package.

```{r courage-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r courage-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(...)
```

```{r courage-2-test, include = FALSE}
library(brms)
```

### 

The **brms** package provides a user-friendly interface to work with the statistical language [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), the leading tool for Bayesian model building.

### Exercise 3

Load the **tidybayes** package.

```{r courage-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r courage-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(...)
```

```{r courage-3-test, include = FALSE}
library(tidybayes)
```

### 

<!-- XX: Some comments about this problem. -->


### Exercise 4

Run this code in order to generate the polling data.

```{r courage-4-ex, exercise = TRUE}
poll_data <- tibble(biden = c(rep(1, 655), 
                              rep(0, 904)))

slice_sample(poll_data, n = 10)
```


```{r courage-4-test, include = FALSE}
poll_data <- tibble(biden = c(rep(1, 655), 
                              rep(0, 904)))

slice_sample(poll_data, n = 10)
```

###

### Exercise 5


```{r courage-5-ex, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r courage-5-hint, eval = FALSE}

```

```{r courage-5-test, include = FALSE}

```

###

### Exercise 6


```{r courage-6-ex, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r courage-6-hint, eval = FALSE}

```

```{r courage-6-test, include = FALSE}

```

###

### Exercise 7


```{r courage-7-ex, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r courage-7-hint, eval = FALSE}

```

```{r courage-7-test, include = FALSE}

```

###



<!-- Questions about models, tests, and the DGM. -->




### Exercise 4

Write a few sentence which summarize your work so far. The first few sentences are the same as what you had at the end of the Justice Section. Add at least one sentence which describes the modelling approach which you are using. Also add at least one sentence which describes the *direction* (not the magnitude) of the relationship between one of your independent variables and your dependent variable.

```{r courage-4}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "XX.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

## Temperance
### 

*Temperance is a tree which as for its root very little contentment, and for its fruit calm and peace.* - Buddha

### Exercise 1

In your own words, describe the use of Temperance in finishing our data science project.

```{r temperance-1}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Temperance guides us in the use of the data generating mechanism --- or the 'model' ---  we have created to answer the questions with which we began. We create posteriors for the quantities of interest.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

<!-- Questions and Answers; Humility -->

### Exercise 2

Write a paragraph which summarizes your project. The first few sentences are the same as what you had at the end of the Courage Section. But, since your question may have evolved, you should feel free to change those sentences. Add at least one sentence which describes at least one quantity of interest --- presumably one that answers your question -- and which provides a measure of uncertainty about that QoI. 

```{r temperance-2}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "XX.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```
