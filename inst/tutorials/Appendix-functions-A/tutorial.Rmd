<!-- Once we rewrite the chapter, there should be lots of good questions. The more that questions can match the chapter, the better. Recall that soon (?), I want to embed the tutorial inside of the chapter itself. This should be relatively easy to do for good questions. -->


<!-- We should have at least two, if not three, tutorials for chapter 3, each 1 to 2 hours long. First does all the list-columns, map_ functions, write your own function preliminaries. The second explores measures of center and variability. The third does some version of the prediction game. -->

## Functions 
###

A function is a piece of code that is packaged in a way that makes it easy to reuse. 

### Exercise 1

Use `sample()` and set `x` to values 5 to 10. Then, set `size` to 1. 


```{r functions-1, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r functions-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Use the  : operator as a shortcut!
```

```{r functions-1-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
sample(x = ...,
       size = ...)
```


### Exercise 2

Let's use `replicate()` to repeat the code you just created. The first argument to `replicate()` should be 5. For the second argument, copy and paste your code from the previous exercise. 


```{r functions-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r functions-2-hint, eval = FALSE}
replicate(..., sample(...))
```

### Exercise 3

Great. Now create a `tibble()` with one variable called `x` . Have `x` take on the values 3, 5, and 9.

```{r functions-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r functions-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(x = c(...))
```

### Exercise 4

Copy/ paste your code from above. Use `|>` operator to use `mutate()` to create a column named `sqrt_x`. `sqrt_x` should be set to `sqrt()` of `x`.

```{r functions-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r functions-4-hint, eval = FALSE}
tibble(x = c(3,5,9)) |> 
  mutate(... = ...)
```

### Exercise 5

Let's create the same output, but now using a `map*` function. We have already provided the tibble. 

Use `mutate()` to create a column named `sqrt_x` set to `map_dbl()`. The first argument to `map_dbl()` should be `x`. The second argument should be  `sqrt()` with the argument `.` inside it.

```{r functions-5, exercise = TRUE}
tibble(x = c(3, 7, 2))
```

```{r functions-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  mutate(sqrt_x = map_dbl(..., ~...))
```

```{r functions-5-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  mutate(sqrt_x = map_dbl(..., ~sqrt(.))
```



## Anonymous functions
###

We can create functions that do operations “on the fly” without bothering to give them a name. 

### Exercise 1

Let's conduct a mathematical operation. Use `tibble()` to create a column `before`. Have `before` take on the values 4, 6, and 8. 

```{r af-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r af-1-hint, eval = FALSE}
tibble(... = c(...))
```

### Exercise 2

Copy/ paste your code from above. Use `|>` to add `mutate()` to create a new column `after`, which is set to `map_dbl()`. The first argument to `map_dbl()` should be `before`. The second argument should be  `~ (. - 1)`, which subtracts the value 1 from each value in `before`.

```{r af-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r af-2-hint, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  mutate(... = map_dbl(..., ~ (. - 1)))
```

## Creating your own functions
###


### Exercise 1

Use `function()` and `{ }` to create a function that multiplies 2 by 3. Name this function `mult_two_three`. On the line below, call your function.

```{r cf-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r cf-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
mult_two_three <- function(){
  ...
}

mult_two_three()
```

```{r cf-1-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
mult_two_three <- function(){
  2 * 3
}

mult_two_three()
```

### Exercise 2

Adjust your function by adding the argument `x` inside `function()`. Then, replace the value 2 within `{ }` with `x`. This way, any value we put inside our function will be multiplied by 3. 


```{r cf-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r cf-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
mult_two_three <- function(...){
  ...
}

```

```{r cf-2-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
mult_two_three <- function(x){
  x * 3
}

```

### Exercise 3

Put your function `mult_two_three()` to the test! Use `mult_two_three()` and set `x` to 4.  

```{r cf-3-setup}
mult_two_three <- function(x){
  x * 3
}

```


```{r cf-3, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r cf-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
mult_two_three(...)
```

```{r cf-3-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
mult_two_three(x = ...)
```

### Exercise 4

Now write a function that subtracts 2 from 5. Name this function `five_minus_two()`. On the line below, call your function.

```{r cf-4, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r cf-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
five_minus_two <- function(){
  ... 
}

five_minus_two()
```

```{r cf-4-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
five_minus_two <- function(){
  ... - ...
}

five_minus_two()
```

### Exercise 5

Now adjust your function `five_minus_two()` so that it now subtracts 2 from `x`.

```{r cf-5, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r cf-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
five_minus_two <- function(...){
  ...
}

```

### Exercise 6

Put your function into action! Use `five_minus_two()` and set `x` set to 18.

```{r cf-6-setup}
five_minus_two <- function(x){
  x - 2
}
```


```{r cf-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

### Exercise 7

Now write a function that takes two variables `x` and `y` and will add them together. Name your function `add_2_var`.

```{r cf-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r cf-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
add_2_var <- function(..., ...){
 ...
}

```

```{r cf-7-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
add_2_var <- function(..., ...){
 ... + ...
}

```

### Exercise 8 

Put your function into action! Use `add_2_var()` with the values 4 and 2 as arguments. 

```{r cf-8-setup}
add_2_var <- function(x){
  x + y
}
```

```{r cf-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r cf-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
add_2_var(...,...)
```
