```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(learnr)
library(primer.tutorials)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
options(tutorial.exercise.timelimit = 60, 
        tutorial.storage = "local") 
```

```{r copy-code-chunk, child = "../../child_documents/copy_button.Rmd"}
```

<!-- Plan is that students are told to read the Getting Started chapter before the first class. We want them to, at least, install R/RStudio before the first class. Then, in class, we do this tutorial together. Given that structure, we should make this a bit longer and ensure that all the important things in Getting Started have, in fact, been done. Maybe this should really be 10 to 15 questions, but I am unsure which are most important. -->

## Introduction
### 

Welcome to your first tutorial! Our goal is to learn how to complete a tutorial and then download your answers. This tutorial assumes that you have read and completed the instructions in the [Getting Started](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/getting-started.html) chapter in the *[Primer](https://ppbds.github.io/primer)*. 

You may complete the tutorials either on your laptop or on a cloud computing platform, if one is provided. Either way, you will download a copy of your work to the Downloads folder on your computer.

You always begin a tutorial by filling out your name/email and then clicking the "Submit Answer" button. If you make a mistake, you can click **"Edit Answer"** and try again. 


```{r info-section, child = "../../child_documents/info_section.Rmd"}
```

## Tutorial exercises 
### 

In each tutorial, there will be a set of exercises for you to complete. You write your answer within the exercise code area and hit the "Submit Code" button when you are done.

Clicking **"Start Over"** --- look for small letters at the bottom of the left-hand side menu --- deletes all your work for this tutorial and allows you to begin the entire tutorial again.

### Exercise 1

Let's practice some simple math. We've already assigned 5 to `x` and 4 to `y`. On the line below those two given lines of code, add the two variables by typing `x + y`. Hit **"Run Code"** to see your results. Clicking **"Hint"** gives you a hint about what to type. 

```{r tutorial-exercises-1, exercise = TRUE}
x <- 5
y <- 4

```

```{r tutorial-exercises-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
x <- 5
y <- 4
x + y
```

###

Once you click **"Run Code"**, the answer `[1] 9` should appear below the code you entered. This is the same behavior you would see if you ran this code in the Console tab, which should be located as one of the tabs in the bottom left box of RStudio.

### Exercise 2

We will often need to copy code from our previous exercises to continue working. To make this easier, we have a `copy previous code` button. Below the following box, click on the `copy previous code` button. 

```{r tutorial-exercises-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

###

This should paste all work from the previous exercise into the following box. Note that this will only copy code which has been run, so make sure you run previous code before using the `copy previous code` button.

### Exercise 3

Let's examine our first dataset. We provide the code to load the `primer.data` library -- this is the package our dataset will come from. Type `trains` below  `library(primer.data)` and then hit **"Run Code"**. This will display some observations from the `trains` dataset. 

```{r tutorial-exercises-3, exercise = TRUE}
library(primer.data)

```

```{r tutorial-exercises-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(primer.data)
trains
```

You should see a table containing information contained in the `trains` dataset. It is always a good idea to explore a dataset before you begin to work with it.

### Exercise 4

Let's check the version of R running on your computer. You can do this by copy-pasting `version[['version.string']]` into the exercise box below and hitting **"Run Code"**. 

```{r tutorial-exercises-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tutorial-exercises-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
version[['version.string']]
```

### 

You should be running R version 4.2.1 or later. If not, re-install R, following the instructions in [Getting Started](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/getting-started.html).

### Exercise 5

Read all of the following instructions before continuing, as this tutorial will close. Restart your **R session** by clicking Session -\> Restart R. (Note that restarting R within this **RStudio instance** is a different thing than restarting your RStudio itself.)

You should receive the warning message shown below. Whenever you see this warning message, keep in mind that clicking "Terminate Jobs" will close any running tutorials. 

```{r}
include_graphics("images/terminate_jobs.png")
```

Click terminate, and re-open this tutorial. Tutorial progress will always be saved automatically.

### Exercise 6

Tutorials can include written responses. You have already seen one example of that when you provided your name and e-mail address at the start.

Copy and paste everything from `Exercise 6` through the end of this sentence into the answer box below.

```{r tutorial-exercises-6}
question_text(NULL,
    message = "We will sometimes provide an answer to written questions. Other times, like here, we won't. In the former case, we will not allow you to resubmit your answer. Don't stress! Tutorials are pass/fail, so, as long as you make an honest effort, you will do fine.",          
    answer(NULL, 
           correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = FALSE,
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 7

Be careful about cutting and pasting code from elsewhere into tutorials. In general, *this will not work!* As an example of it not working, copy/paste the `x + y` operation you just did in `Exercise 1`.

```{r tutorial-exercises-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tutorial-exercises-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
x + y
```

This should report an error like "object 'x' not found" since we did not define `x` or `y` in this specific exercise box. This code would work if you copied the entire exercise box from `Exercise 1`, like we did with the `copy previous code` button. No need to fix it.

### Exercise 8

Copy the following commands into the R Console, and hit enter.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(rstudioapi)
writeRStudioPreference("save_workspace", "never")
writeRStudioPreference("load_workspace", FALSE)
writeRStudioPreference("insert_native_pipe_operator", TRUE)
writeRStudioPreference("show_hidden_files", TRUE)
```

### 

The first two functions change the default value of RStudio to start each session afresh, with no junk leftover from your last session. This makes it much easier to create a reproducible analysis. The third and fourth change some of the default settings for RStudio.

To confirm that you have done this, run `rstudioapi::readRStudioPreference(name = "load_workspace", default = "Code failed.")` from the R Console. Copy/paste the command and the answer below.

```{r tutorial-exercises-8}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

The response should be FALSE. If it is not, try re-running the commands above.

### Exercise 9

Run `primer.tutorials::install_only_binary_packages()` in the Console. Restart the R Session. Now, type `options("pkgType")` in your RStudio Console and hit return. Copy/paste the command and the return value below. 

```{r tutorial-exercises-9}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

The return value should be "binary". 

## Your answers
### 

At the end of every tutorial, you will save your work and submit it. We will do this in the next panel, labeled "Submit." Follow the instructions there. After hitting the "Download" button, you will be prompted to save a file named `getting-started_answers.rds` or `getting-started_answers.html`, depending on which button you picked. This file will be saved in the default Downloads folder on your laptop, even if you completed the tutorial on a cloud computing platform.

Future tutorials will prompt you with a file name which matches the tutorial you have just completed. The suffix will always be `rds` or `html`, indicating the type of file. Whenever you submit work, it should be in the form of the `rds` file. The `html` file can be useful to see all answers from a tutorial listed out.
